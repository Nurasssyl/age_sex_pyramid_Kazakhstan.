# age_sex_pyramid_Kazakhstan.

I made an age-sex pyramid of Kazakhstan 🇰🇿

I developed this visualization using the R programming language and libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, readr, tidur.

Total population by gender: 👨 males - 9,783,814, 👩 females - 10,250,028.

According to the pyramid, you can see:

The high number of young people (0-15 years old) indicates a high birth rate.

🚶‍♂️ There is some narrowing in the age groups from 20 to 35 years old, which may be due to migration, outflow of young people, changes in fertility or mortality in these age groups.

Gender imbalance: There are significantly more women in the older age groups, which reflects the longer life expectancy of women.
